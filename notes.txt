1. Networking basics

Networking means the communication between 2 or more devices.
Protocols are the rules used for networking.

client - req karne vaala
server - response dene vaala

- Protocols

    HTTP : for web browsing
    HHTPS : secure web communication
    FTP : file transfer
    SSH : secure shell, remote access
    DNS : domain - IP mapping
    TCP/IP : internet ke backbone Protocols


- IP Address

    every device which is connected to internet or local network has an ip address.
    example: 
        192.168.0.1 - local network
        142.250.193.78 - google's ip
    
    types:
        IPv4 - 4 parts, 0-255
        IPv6 - more longer and complex


- MAC address

    physical address of the device's network interface
    unique for every device
    mostly used for lan lvl comm


- DNS

    converts domain to ip
        nslookup google.com - will return ip of the site



2.TCP/IP & ports

transmission control protocol / internet protocol
it is a comm model which tells how data travels on the internet

IP decides where to send the package
TCP ensures how and how much

- Layers

    apps : chrome, whatsapp, etc.
    transport : reliable delivery (TCP/UDP)
    internet : ip address and routing
    network access : physical sending (like ethernet/wi-fi)


- TCP vs UDP

    | Feature     | TCP (Used in Scanning)   | UDP                  |
    | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
    | Reliable?   | ✅ Yes (acknowledgements)| ❌ No (best effort)  |
    | Speed       | Slower                   | Faster               |
    | Use Case    | Web, Email, SSH, etc.    | Streaming, DNS, VoIP |
    | Connection? | Yes (handshake)          | No connection needed |

    TCP:
    3 way handshake
    syn - synchronize
    ack - acknowledgement
        1. SYN: client --> server
        2. SYN+ACK: server --> client
        3. ACK: client --> server
        connection done 
        if all steps complete then the port is open and if any step fails, the port is closed or filtered.


- Ports 
    logical door of a system jaha services baithi hoti hai 
    when we are scanning an ip address, we are actually seeing which ports are open and what services they provide

    port no ranges:
        | Port Type        | Range       | Example                |
        | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
        | Well-known Ports | 0–1023      | 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) |
        | Registered Ports | 1024–49151  | 3306 (MySQL), etc.     |
        | Dynamic/Private  | 49152–65535 | Temporary use          |
    
    port states:
        whenever we scan a port it is in a states

        open - a service is actively listening
        closed - port is not active 
        filtered - scanner not getting any response, maybe because of firewall
        unfiltered - scanner got a response but unsure
